## üéØ About

This project was built with the purpose of learning how to structure a Web App of a mid-level complexity integrating the React Chat Engine API. I put a lot of effort into it and I hope that you could like it.<br/><br/>
The Web App lands you to an Authentication page, in which you can choose to sign in with any of the accounts given below. Once you are logged in, you will land on the homepage, in which you can find the chats.<br/>
You can add a user by entering the username of the user in the "type a username" input box and press enter to add the user.<br/>
‚û°Ô∏è Go try it and please let me know if you enjoyed it with a ‚≠êÔ∏è, I would appreciate it a lot.
